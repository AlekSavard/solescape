A massive, power hungry, polluting complex...but a necessary one.  Space is the only escape.  The Launch Facility will allow you to build space solar satellites and space station and launch them into orbit. Launch Facilities are also responsible for the maintenance and supply of any satellites they launch, disabling or destroying them will also disable or destroy any Solar Arrays or Space Stations they launched.
